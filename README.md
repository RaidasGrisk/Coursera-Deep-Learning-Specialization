# Coursera-Deep-Learning-Specialization

This is a place where I store problem sets for [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). The goal is to learn more about CNNs and RNNs, so I'm putting all the emphasis on the last three courses.

The specialization includes 5 courses:

1. Neural networks and deep learning
2. Improving deep neural networks
3. Structuring machine learning projects
4. [Convolutional neural networks](/Convolutional%20neural%20networks)
- [week 1](/Convolutional%20neural%20networks/week1/):  Basics of CNN
- [week 2](/Convolutional%20neural%20networks/week2/):  Residual Networks and Inception Networks
5. Sequance models
