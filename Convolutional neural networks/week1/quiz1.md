1. What do you think applying this filter to a grayscale image will do?

- [ ] Detect image contrast
- [ ] Detect 45 degree edges
- [x] Detect vertical edges
- [ ] Detect horizontal edges 

2. Suppose your input is a 300 by 300 color (RGB) image, and you are not using a convolutional network. If the first hidden layer has 100 neurons, each one fully connected to the input, how many parameters does this hidden layer have (including the bias parameters)?
- [ ] 9,000,001
- [ ] 9,000,100
- [ ] 27,000,001
- [x] 27,000,100

3. Suppose your input is a 300 by 300 color (RGB) image, and you use a convolutional layer with 100 filters that are each 5x5. How many parameters does this hidden layer have (including the bias parameters)?
- [ ] 2501
- [ ] 2600 (5 * 5 * 100 + 100, I think this one should be the correct answer, but it acctually says no)
- [ ] 7500
- [x] 7600

4. You have an input volume that is 63x63x16, and convolve it with 32 filters that are each 7x7, using a stride of 2 and no padding. What is the output volume?
- [x] 29x29x32
- [ ] 29x29x16
- [ ] 16x16x32
- [ ] 16x16x16

5. You have an input volume that is 15x15x8, and pad it using “pad=2.” What is the dimension of the resulting volume (after padding)?
- [ ] 19x19x12
- [ ] 17x17x10
- [ ] 17x17x8
- [x] 19x19x8

6.You have an input volume that is 63x63x16, and convolve it with 32 filters that are each 7x7, and stride of 1. You want to use a “same” convolution. What is the padding?
- [ ] 1
- [ ] 2
- [x] 3
- [ ] 7

7. You have an input volume that is 32x32x16, and apply max pooling with a stride of 2 and a filter size of 2. What is the output volume?
- [ ] 16x16x8
- [ ] 32x32x8
- [ ] 15x15x16
- [x] 16x16x16

8. Because pooling layers do not have parameters, they do not affect the backpropagation (derivatives) calculation.
- [ ] True
- [x] False

9. In lecture we talked about “parameter sharing” as a benefit of using convolutional networks. Which of the following statements about parameter sharing in ConvNets are true? (Check all that apply.)
- [x] It allows a feature detector to be used in multiple locations throughout the whole input image/input volume.
- [x] It reduces the total number of parameters, thus reducing overfitting.
- [ ] It allows parameters learned for one task to be shared even for a different task (transfer learning).
- [ ] It allows gradient descent to set many of the parameters to zero, thus making the connections sparse.

10. In lecture we talked about “sparsity of connections” as a benefit of using convolutional layers. What does this mean?
- [ ] Regularization causes gradient descent to set many of the parameters to zero.
- [ ] Each filter is connected to every channel in the previous layer.
- [ ] Each layer in a convolutional network is connected only to two other layers
- [x] Each activation in the next layer depends on only a small number of activations from the previous layer.
